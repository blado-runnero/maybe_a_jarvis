- **(18 Jan,2018)**  :-  Right now I have just a very simple draft, of it saying, "Good Morning" and "Good Evening". I am not sure where I got this from, but I remember I copied it from quora, so I named it quora.vbs , so yes for the first version we will use VBS. (I know nothing for VBS(or Visual Basic if I am correct), but just some java.)
